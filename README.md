# LED-Matrix

##This is the first batch of code to test the 8 x 12 matrix that i have created.

###A few things that i need to work out and change are the following.


 Addressing each (0,0) co-ordinate pixel as a number, so (0,0) would be pixel (1).

 Being able to turn the LED's off/reset them in one go---Bearing in mind there is 96 of them.

 Being able to turn the LED's on in a small raw input scrip --- IE use the keyboard "Q" to show pixel 1 with it's radius

 Fading in the pixels, I beleive it's something to do with Float --- Currently reaserching this.

As mentioned this is a work in progress, If anyone has suggestions please feel free to shoot them over.
