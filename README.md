# LED-Matrix - Skywriter - Music

This should* be a simple script that enables an LED patern when the skywriter receives an input.
The Matrix will then light up in set patterns and beats and also play along with music arpeggios.

So far what has been done is preparing the LED matrix, the next step is to integrate the Skywriter board into the LED script so it can activate and set co-ordiante from the Skywriter grid.
  If anyone has any suggestions on how to easily incorporate this please do mention something
I have split the mass of the project into 3 files, 1 for the LED, 1 for the skywriter and 1 merged of the two which is currently broken code.
